# Hey you, yea you, want to learn Git/Github and emulate a dev team environment?

Then join me in this 100devs collaboration project open to anyone doing the 100devs bootcamp!

If you are completely new to git and Github, I'll do my best to outline resources for you to read/view that will get you set up:

# The 3 resources I've followed thus far are:

1. The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/installation-overview
This walks you through setting up a virtual machine on your computer so you can code in Linux OS. It shows you how to set up git on your OS and the following section: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/introduction-to-git teaches you the most basic git commands you'll need to know and how to use CLI. 

2. Corey Schafer is the best youtube resource I've found for explaining coding in general. He has a great video that covers the basic git commands and how you'd use git in a team: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4

3. Finally, to understand Opensource and how to contribute to any opensource project on Github, I've been reading this site: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source

## At this point in time, the current workflow I'd like for everyone to follow is:

1. Fork this repo and clone it on your local drive. 
2. Make a branch with a name that identifies you (ex: cho-cho-branch) 
3. Organize your files in a directory (folder) called name-assignment in the corresponding folder for the week we're at in the bootcamp. ex (100devs/week-1/cho-cho-bbc-webpage/)
4. Push your branch to this repo and make a pull request. So long as you have followed steps 1-3, I will accept your code and merge it with master.
  4b: To delete your branch and the remote branch that you push use git branch d- branch name to delete locally. Then git push origin --delete branch name to delete your pushed branch. 
5. Now anyone who has this repo forked and updates with git pull will have a copy of your work that they can view on their machine in their text editor to easily make suggestions/comments.
6. Teamwork makes the dream work (?)

### Please DM me on Discord: cho_cho #8835 if you have suggestions on how to make this project work more efficiently. I am still new to Git/Github myself. 

O almost forgot, as an added bonus, those of us who are active in this repo should all vote on the best submission for each week's assignment. Once we choose the best user submission, I'll deploy the site on Netlify to show off to our classmates!

The current sites in this repo are deployed here: 
* https://pedantic-blackwell-40a88c.netlify.app/
* https://lucid-mclean-e5431f.netlify.app/
