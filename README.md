I'm making this repository for collaboration with fellow classmates in the 100devs bootcamp. I'm still new to Git so I want to get comfortable sharing and collaborating code on git and understanding the proper workflow and use of branching and merging to main with other people's contributions. 

Please read the Wiki and let me know if you have suggestions/ideas for how we can learn to code together with Git/GitHub!
